# LOAD BALANCER AND WEB SERVER

Set up a load balancer container, such as Nginx or HAProxy.
Create multiple web server containers running a simple web application.
Configure the load balancer to distribute incoming requests among the web server containers.
Test the load balancing functionality by sending requests to the load balancer and observing how they are distributed across the web server containers.
